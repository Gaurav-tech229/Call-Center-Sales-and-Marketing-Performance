# Call Center Sales and Marketing Performance

## Overview
This project creates an interactive Excel-based dashboard for analyzing call center performance. It processes 200,000 call records from a CSV file, providing insights into call outcomes, agent performance, product discussions, customer demographics, and trends. The dashboard uses PivotTables, charts, slicers, and VBA macros for dynamic visualizations and filtering.

## Features
- **Key Metrics Overview**: Displays total calls, success/failure/abandoned rates, average agent ratings, and call durations.
- **Agent Performance**: Filter by agent to view success rates, ratings, call volumes, and breakdowns by product/outcome.
- **Trends and Visuals**: Monthly trends via slicers, product distribution charts, state-based maps/charts (toggleable via buttons), and reasons for abandoned calls.
- **Customer Insights**: Analysis by age, gender, state, income bracket, and repeat status.
- **Interactive Elements**: VBA macros to toggle map/chart views and slicer visibility; supports filtering by month, agent, product, etc.
- **Data-Driven Recommendations**: Highlights actionable insights, e.g., optimizing staffing to reduce 22.32% abandonment rate or targeting high-value states like New York.

## Technologies Used
- **Microsoft Excel**: PivotTables, charts (bar, pie, line), slicers, conditional formatting, formulas (e.g., AVERAGEIF, SUMIFS).
- **VBA Macros**: For toggling visibility of shapes (e.g., maps, charts, buttons) and slicers.
- **Data Processing**: Imported CSV data into Excel sheets for analysis.
